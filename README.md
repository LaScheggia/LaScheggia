## :zap: Some quotes I live up to :snowflake:
**Dr. Toshiya Joushima once said**
> *If you aren't continuously looking up and putting in the effort, 
> you can't reach the next level.*

**Keisuke Takahashi**
> *The wounds run deep.
> The pain is almost unbearable, 
> but that doesn't give us the right 
> to just curl up and die. 
> No matter how hard thigs get,
> it's our responsibility to keep moving forward.*
